### Usage

#### In a Script - purely for development
Assuming you already created a Django project at '/path/to/your/django/project'
(if not please do so)

Before installing django-papaye you MUST first:

1) Install pyenv: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
2) Install a python3.9 version via pyenv: 
```bash
pyenv install 3.9.19
```

3) In a new terminal tab, create a specific python virtual environment via pyenv: 
```bash
cd /path/to/your/django/project  # go to you django project root folder (same folder where manage.py is)

pyenv shell 3.9.19  # switches to this specific version of python for this terminal tab until it's closed

python3 --version  # it should print out 'Python 3.9.19'

python3 -m venv venv-3.9

source venv-3.9/bin/activate  # to activate your venv-3.9
```

5) Then configure your django transcrypt environment by executing this command:
```bash

#### From the Command Line

NOTE: Even better, configure a custom keyboard shortcut! I use control alt l.

run in a terminal: ```login```

If you need to reconfigure (run in a terminal) ```configure```

To install from source and develop:

cd lib_work_login
pip3 install wheel --upgrade
pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
python3 setup.py develop
```

### System Requirements
* [django\-papaye](#django\-papaye)

Must have linux. You can prob change easily to support other OSes, but not currently supported

## Testing
* [django\-papaye](#django\-papaye)

Run tests on install by doing:
```pip3 install lib_off_campus_housing_parser --force --install-option test```
This will install the package, force the command line arguments to be installed, and run the tests
NOTE: You might need sudo to install command line arguments when doing this

You can test the package if in development by moving/cd into the directory where setup.py is located and running:
```python3 setup.py test```

To test a specific submodule, cd into that submodule and run:
```pytest```

Note: I currently have not written any tests, since I have tried the program and checked it's output by hand so I know that it works. I know that this is not sufficient, but no one is going to use this thing but me so whatevs.
